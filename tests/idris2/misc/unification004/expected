1/1: Building Good (Good.idr)
1/1: Building Bad (Bad.idr)
Error: While processing left hand side of foo. When unifying:
    View W
and:
    View ?a
Pattern variable a unifies with: W.

Bad:6:12--10:8
    |
 6 |   X : View W
   |            ^
 07 |   Y : View U
 10 | foo a X = MkUnit
    |       ^

Suggestion: Use the same name for both pattern variables, since they unify.
